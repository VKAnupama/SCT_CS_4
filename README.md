**Basic Keylogger**

This is a basic keylogger built using Python and the pynput library.
The program records every keystroke along with the exact timestamp and saves them to a text file.
It demonstrates how keylogging works and how keyboard inputs can be captured in a controlled ethical environment.

** Features **

- Logs all keyboard inputs

- Records date & time for each keystroke

- Handles both normal keys and special keysxx

- Saves captured keystrokes to keylog_timestamp.txt

- Can be stopped safely by pressing the ESC key
